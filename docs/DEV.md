# Developer notes

How this collection is put together, the conventions to follow, and how
to add another game. For per-game *rules* see [`rules.md`](rules.md).

## Philosophy

- **No build step.** Plain HTML/CSS/JS. It runs from `file://`,
  `python -m http.server`, or GitHub Pages with no tooling.
- **Framework-free.** Everything shared lives on one global,
  `window.ArcadeCommon` (`js/common.js`), created by an IIFE.
- **Offline-capable.** No CDNs. Icons are an inlined subset of Lucide;
  sound is synthesised with WebAudio (no asset files).
- **Relative paths everywhere**, so the site can live at any base URL.
- **Each game owns its own HUD + scoring.** The shared chrome only
  provides the lifecycle, overlay, loop and a generic high-score store —
  it never hard-codes a game's stats. A game defines whatever HUD pills
  it wants in its own page and updates them itself.

## File layout

```
index.html                   Launcher (game picker)
favicon.svg                  Four arcade buttons
css/common.css               Theme tokens (CSS variables) + launcher styles + toast
css/game.css                 Shared game-page chrome: topbar, HUD pills, stamina bar,
                             controls, canvas stage, start/pause/over overlay
js/common.js                 ArcadeCommon — all shared plumbing (see below)
js/games/ladder-connect.js   One file per game: logic + Canvas 2D rendering
docs/rules.md                Player-facing rules
docs/DEV.md                  This file
```

## `ArcadeCommon` surface (`js/common.js`)

| Namespace | What |
| --- | --- |
| `storage` | `readJSON` / `writeJSON` / `storageKey` — namespaced `localStorage` (prefix `arcadeGames`). |
| `prefs` | `get(game)` / `set(game, patch)` — per-game preferences. |
| `scores` | `best(game, mode)` / `submit(game, mode, score, meta)` / `stats(game)` — per-(game, mode) high scores + a recent-runs ring buffer. |
| `rng` | `make(seed)` (mulberry32) + `int` / `float` / `one` / `shuffle`. |
| `math` | `clamp` / `lerp` / `dist`. |
| `format` | `score(n)` (thousands) / `clock(ms|sec, asSeconds)` (mm:ss). |
| `el` / `svgEl` | Tiny DOM/SVG builders. |
| `icon(name)` / `icons.render(root)` | Inline Lucide-subset icons; fills every `[data-icon]` placeholder. |
| `i18n` | EN/中 strings, `t(key, ...args)`, `setLocale`, `subscribe`, `translateNode`, and the mutable `STRINGS` table. |
| `toast` | One shared bottom-centre notice: `toast.show(text, ms)`. |
| `input.keyboard(opts)` | Window-level key state + edge (`onPress`) callbacks. |
| `loop.create(opts)` | Fixed-timestep rAF loop (accumulator). |
| `audio` | WebAudio blip synth. `play(name)`; `unlock()`; `isMuted` / `toggleMuted`. |
| `shell.create(opts)` | Lifecycle + overlay + loop glue (below). |

### The shell

`shell.create(opts)` owns the state machine
`idle → playing → paused → over`, the fixed-timestep loop, the
start/pause/over overlay, and the Pause / Restart / Sound buttons and
their keyboard shortcuts. The game supplies `update(dt)` / `render()` /
`reset()` and calls `shell.gameOver({ score, win, meta })` when the run
ends. It intentionally knows nothing about the game's own HUD.

Config keys: `gameId`, `mode()` (leaderboard bucket), `step`,
`preventKeys`, `update`, `render`, `reset`, `onStart` / `onPause` /
`onResume` / `onGameOver`, `restartToReady` (Restart → ready screen), and `overlayContent(state, result)` returning
`{ badge, title, message, button, hint }`.

DOM ids the shell looks for (all optional): `#overlay`,
`#overlay-badge`, `#overlay-title`, `#overlay-message`, `#overlay-btn`,
`#overlay-hint`, `#pause-btn`, `#restart-btn`, `#sound-btn`, `#best`.

Global shortcuts: `Space`/`Enter` start from idle/over, `P`/`Esc` pause,
`R` restart (to the ready screen if `restartToReady`), `M` mute.
Switching tabs mid-run auto-pauses.

### i18n conventions

- `data-i18n="key"` sets `textContent`; keys ending in **`Html`** set
  `innerHTML` (may contain markup / `[data-icon]`).
- `data-i18n-title` / `data-i18n-aria-label` handle those attributes.
- A game registers its strings by mutating
  `ArcadeCommon.i18n.STRINGS.en` / `.zh` at load time (top of the game
  file, synchronously) — before the DOM-ready translate pass.
- Dynamic text subscribes with `ArcadeCommon.i18n.subscribe(cb)`.

## Adding a new game

1. **Launcher card** in `index.html`: copy a `.game-card` block, give it
   a class (e.g. `panda-dash`) and `href="./games/panda-dash.html"`.
2. **Accent colour**: add `.game-card.<class> { --game-color: #…; }` in
   `css/common.css`, and set `body { --game-color: #…; }` in the game
   page's inline `<style>`.
3. **Game page** `games/<id>.html`: copy `ladder-connect.html` — topbar,
   the HUD pills **your** game needs, a `.stage-wrap` with the
   `<canvas id="stage">` + overlay, controls, and the *How to play*
   footer. Load `../js/common.js` then `../js/games/<id>.js`.
4. **Game module** `js/games/<id>.js`: an IIFE that
   - registers its strings on `AC.i18n.STRINGS`,
   - grabs the canvas + its own HUD nodes,
   - builds state,
   - calls `AC.shell.create({ gameId, update, render, reset, … })`,
   - wires its own input and updates its own HUD,
   - calls `shell.gameOver({ score, win })` when the run ends.
5. **Launcher strings** for the card go in `js/common.js` `STRINGS`
   (EN + 中); per-game gameplay strings stay in the game file.
6. Add a rules section to `docs/rules.md`.

Canvas convention: render at a fixed logical resolution (Ladder Connect
uses 600×760 portrait, capped/centred via a `.stage-wrap { max-width }`
on its page) and scale the backing store by `devicePixelRatio` in a
`fitCanvas()`.

## Ladder Connect internals

- **Tuning lives up top** in `CONFIG` (shared: `ballSpeed`, wave gap, …) +
  `DIFFICULTIES` (per preset: the fixed layout `lanes`=`colors`, `lives`,
  `twoBall` chance, and the `freq` wave-rate curve). Change balance there.
- **Difficulty** is a preset (`easy` / `normal` / `hard`), chosen with
  the on-page selector and stored in prefs; high scores are kept
  per-difficulty (`shell.mode` returns `G.difficulty`). Each preset has one
  **fixed layout** where `lanes === colors`, so every basket is a distinct
  colour.
- **Ladder model.** `G.rungs` is a fixed list of `{ gap, y, color }` (gap = the
  left lane of the pair; `y` = a free, continuous height; `color` = the one
  colour it does NOT affect). A ball tracks its logical `lane` and each frame
  crosses any adjacent rung whose colour differs from it (in height order) —
  a ball slips straight through rungs of its own colour — easing its `x`
  toward the lane centre (`CONFIG.xEase`) for a diagonal slide.
  Lanes draw a faint full-height rail plus a brighter capped segment marking
  the rung band (`POINT_TOP`–`POINT_BOTTOM`).
- **Colour-gate rungs.** `initRungs` seeds **one rung per colour**
  (`COLOR_SETS[G.colors]`) at random continuous heights, nudged apart by
  `resolveDropY`. A rung deflects
  every colour EXCEPT its own (a ball passes straight through its own colour's
  rungs), so every rung interacts with almost every ball — managing those side
  effects is the puzzle, and an own-colour rung is a "safe gate". Drawn as a
  neutral bar with coloured end-rings (`drawRung`). Rungs move, never add/remove.
  Pointer input grabs the rung under the cursor (`rungIndexAt`); while held it
  is placed freely — the gap snaps to the nearest pair (`nearestGap`) and the
  height follows the cursor. `resolveDropY` dodges conflicts: rungs that share a
  lane (same or adjacent gap) must stay `CONFIG.rungMinSep` apart, so the ghost
  slides to the nearest free height (or turns red / snaps back if the column is
  full). The held rung keeps steering at its old spot until release
  (`drawDragGhost`).
- **Baskets** (`makeBaskets`) lay the layout's distinct colours across the
  lanes (one per lane). A ball's colour (chosen uniformly, differing within a
  wave) is both its destination (the same-colour basket) and the rung colour
  that can move it.
- **Steady wave spawning.** `waveRate()` ramps `freq.start → freq.end` over
  `freq.tau` (log-paced). A single accumulator (`G.spawnAcc`) fires a wave when
  it crosses 1 and `CONFIG.waveMinGap` has passed; the rhythm stays even (no
  jitter). `spawnWave` drops one ball, or two (on distinct free lanes) with
  `DIFFICULTIES.*.twoBall` probability — never more than two.
- **Constant speed.** Every ball falls at `CONFIG.ballSpeed`, the same for all
  difficulties and unchanging over time.
- **No overlap at spawn.** `laneBlockedAtTop` keeps a lane clear until its top
  ball descends past `CONFIG.laneClearY`; within a two-ball wave `createBall`'s
  `used` set forces two different colours (so two colours are live at once and
  two rungs are needed). Balls that still converge into one lane are spread
  side by side for readability (`drawBalls`).
- **Difficulty over time** is only the wave rate rising (`timePressure`),
  approaching `freq.end` but never reaching it. Easy and Normal share one
  curve; Hard's is slightly higher.
- **Delivery** compares the ball's colour to its final lane's basket:
  correct → fixed score + `+score` floater; wrong → a life lost; zero
  lives ends the run. (No combo system.)

## Debug / dev affordances

All gated behind `?debug=1` on the game page and tagged in code with a
`[DEBUG-HOOK]` comment (find them with `rg "\[DEBUG-HOOK\]"`).

### URL flags (`games/ladder-connect.html`)

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `?debug=1` | Enables the debug overlay, keyboard shortcuts and the `window.LC` console API. |
| `?t=<seconds>` | Starts every run at that elapsed time — jumps the difficulty (wave rate) to that moment. Works with or without `?debug`. |

Example: `games/ladder-connect.html?debug=1&t=120`.

### Console API — `window.LC` (debug only)

| Call | What |
| --- | --- |
| `LC.setTime(sec)` / `LC.addTime(sec=30)` | Jump the difficulty clock. |
| `LC.addLife(n=1)` | Add lives. |
| `LC.diff("easy"\|"normal"\|"hard")` | Switch difficulty (restarts). |
| `LC.info()` | Snapshot of the live state. |

### Debug keys (debug only)

`]` +30s difficulty · `[` −30s difficulty · `L` +1 life. A readout in
the top-right shows difficulty, elapsed, layout, wave rate (waves/10s), the
two-ball chance, and ball count.

### Stripping the debug code later

Everything above is gated behind `?debug=1` and tagged `[DEBUG-HOOK]`.
To remove: `rg "\[DEBUG-HOOK\]"`, delete those lines (`PARAMS` /
`DEBUG` / `START_T`, the two `if (DEBUG) …` calls), set the run's start
time back from `START_T` to `0` in `resetRun`, and delete the
`setupDebug` / `drawDebugOverlay` functions. Nothing else references
them.

### Ungated logging

Defensive `console.warn` in `js/common.js` (storage read/write + i18n
subscriber failures). Find with `rg "console\.(log|warn)"`.

## Run locally & deploy
